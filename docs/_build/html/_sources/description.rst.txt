Use and Application of the package
-----------------------------------
The ``det3pa`` package is specifically designed to address critical challenges in deploying machine learning models, particularly focusing on the robustness and reliability of models under real-world conditions. 
It provides comprehensive tools for evaluating model stability and performance in the face of **covariate shifts, and problematic data profiles.**

Key functionalities
-------------------

- **Covariate Shift Detection:** Utilizing the detectron subpackage, det3pa can identify significant shifts in data distributions that might affect the modelâ€™s predictions. This feature is crucial for applications such as predictive maintenance, financial modeling, and healthcare, where early detection of shifts can prevent erroneous decisions.

- **Uncertainty and Confidence Estimation:** Through the med3pa subpackage, the package measures the uncertainty and predictive confidence at both individual and group levels. This helps in understanding the reliability of model predictions and in making informed decisions based on model outputs.

- **Identification of Problematic Profiles**: det3pa analyzes data profiles that consistently lead to poor model performance. This capability allows developers to refine training datasets or retrain models to handle these edge cases effectively.
